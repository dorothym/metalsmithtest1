# README.md

This project is an experiment using the Metalsmith static site generator.

I've used it to create three main pages:
 * the homepage, listing all blog entries and project articles
 * the "all blog entries" page, listing blog entries
 * the "all projects" page, listing all project articles

There are three Metalsmith collections:
 * all articles
 * blogs
 * projects

To run it on your machine:
 * make sure you have NodeJS installed
 * download the repo and run `npm install`
 * to start, run `npm start`
 * you will find the main page on localhost:3030/home
