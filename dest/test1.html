<h2 id="hear-ye-hear-ye-internet-citizens-">Hear ye, hear ye, internet citizens!</h2>
<p>I’m ‘officially’ repurposing this blog to be tech-only (fewer letters, more bits :-) as part of my enrollment at web programming bootcamp.</p>
<p>I promise less color commentary about random UI quirks that I find in my daily digital life, and more about coding.</p>
<p><em>&lt;/end of official pronouncement&gt;</em></p>
